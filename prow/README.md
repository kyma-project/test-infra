# Prow Production Configuration
## Overview
This project contains a set of configuration files for the Prow production cluster.
## Prerequisites


Install the following tools:

- Kubernetes 1.10+ on GKE
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)

### Google Cloud Platform configuration

- A global static IP address with the `prow-production` name.
- A DNS registry for the `status.build.kyma-project.io` domain that points to the `prow-production` address.

### Secrets
The obligatory Secrets include:
- `hmac-token` which is a Prow HMAC token used for GitHub Webhooks.
- `oauth-token` which is a GitHub token with read and write access to the `kyma-bot` account.
- `compute-service-account` which is a Google Cloud service account with the following roles:
  - Service Account User
  - Compute Admin
  - Compute OS Admin Login

## Installation

1. Ensure that `kubectl` points to the correct cluster. For GKE, execute the following command:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials {CLUSTER_NAME} --zone={ZONE_NAME} --project={PROJECT_NAME}
```

2. Export the environment variables:
 - **BUCKET_NAME** is a GCS bucket in the Google Cloud project that is used to store Prow Secrets.
 - **KEYRING_NAME** is the KMS key ring.
 - **ENCRYPTION_KEY_NAME** is the key name in the key ring that is used for data encryption.

 ```
 export BUCKET_NAME=kyma-prow
 export KEYRING_NAME=kyma-prow
 export ENCRYPTION_KEY_NAME=kyma-prow-encryption
 ```
 
3. Run the following script to start the installation process:

```bash
./install-prow.sh
```

The installation script performs the following steps to install Prow:

- Deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller.
- Create a ClusterRoleBinding.
- Deploy Prow components with the `a202e595a33ac92ab503f913f2d710efabd3de21`revision.
- Deploy Cert Manager.
- Deploy Secure Ingress.
- Removes Insecure Ingress.

To check if the installation is successful, perform the following steps:

1. Check if all Pods are up and running:
   `kubeclt get pods`
2. Check if the Deck is accessible from outside of the cluster:
   `kubectl get ingress tls-ing`
   Copy the address of the `tls-ing` Ingress and open it in a browser to display the Prow status on the dashboard.
