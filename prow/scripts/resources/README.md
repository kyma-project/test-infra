## Prometheus operator additional scrape configuration

Prometheus operator expects to have additional scrape configuration provided as a Secret. This Secret is appended to the Prometheus scrape config file.
Additional scrape config allows you to add scrape targets outside automatic scrape targets discovery mechanisms.
It is administrator's responsibility to provide syntactically correct scrape configuration.

## Debug commando

Debug commando is a pod with debugging tools. It contains an oomfinder container which listens for oom events published by the containerisation engine. Oomfinder requires a privileged context. To allow this, the debug commando pod is running under a `gardener.cloud:psp:privileged` policy. To use debug commando, follow these steps: 
* Make sure your prowjob calls [utils::debug_oom](https://github.com/kyma-project/test-infra/blob/732e1fc8cc887d4328ce457c7af9566fae79be97/prow/scripts/lib/utils.sh#L317) just after creating a k8s cluster.
* Make sure your prowjob calls [utils::oom_get_output](https://github.com/kyma-project/test-infra/blob/732e1fc8cc887d4328ce457c7af9566fae79be97/prow/scripts/lib/utils.sh#L295) as a last step before cluster cleanup begins.
* Label your prowjob with `preset-debug-commando-oom: "true"`.
