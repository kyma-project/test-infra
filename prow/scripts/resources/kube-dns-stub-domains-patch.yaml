# Some test create new dns record on every execution.
# It takes ~10min to propagate new value to DNS servers.
# Using stubDomains configuration we can decrease this delay by querying
# directly DNS servers that are responsible for a given domain.
# We override following domains:
# build.kyma-project.io - ns-cloud-d1-d4.googledomains.com.
#  "216.239.32.109", "216.239.34.109", "216.239.36.109", "216.239.38.109"
# a.build.kyma-project.io - ns-cloud-b1-b4.googledomains.com.
#  "216.239.32.107","216.239.34.107","216.239.36.107","216.239.38.107"
