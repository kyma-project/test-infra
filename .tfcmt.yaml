# Configuration file for tfcmt tool used to run terraform commands and post results to github.

# plan_patch option enables patching existing tfcmt comments instead of creating new ones.
# This is useful when you want to keep the comment history clean. This option is valid for the tfcmt plan command only.
# Setting it in configuration file instead of a command line argument will make it default for all plan commands without
# need to define separate arguments list for the apply command. This makes the tekton terraform-executor task definition simpler and more readable.
