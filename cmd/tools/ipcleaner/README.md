# IP cleaner

## Overview

This command finds and removes orphaned IP addresses created by jobs in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project.

There are three conditions used to find addresses for removal:
- The address name pattern is not on the ignored list.
- The **users** field of the address shows `0`, which means that the disk is unused.
- The `creationTimestamp` value of the address, that is used to find addresses, exists at least for a preconfigured number of hours.

IP addresses that meet these conditions are subject to removal.

## Usage

For safety reasons, the dry-run mode is the default one.
To run it, use:
```bash
env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={path to service account file} go run main.go \
    --project={gcloud project name}
```

To turn the dry-run mode off, use:
```bash
env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={path to service account file} go run main.go \
    --project={gcloud project name} \
    --dry-run=false
```
