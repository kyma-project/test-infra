# Prow secrets management

## Overview

This document explains secrets management for Prow. Some jobs require using sensitive data. You need to encrypt data using KMS and store them in GCP. The following instructions assume that you are logged-in to the Google Cloud project with administrative rights.

## Prerequisities

You need to have [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) installed. 

We encourage you to read about [creating key rings and keys](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-keys).

For your convenience export the following data:
 - PROJECT_NAME - Google Cloud Project
 - BUCKET_NAME - GCS bucket in the $PROJECT_NAME, where Prow secrets are stored
 - KEYRING_NAME - KMS key ring
 - ENCRYPTION_KEY_NAME - key from the $KEYRING_NAME key ring, used for data encryption

## Secrets management

>**NOTE:** Before following this guide check Prow secrets setup for the $PROJECT_NAME. Make sure that you execute all `gcloud` commands against the $PROJECT_NAME.

Set context to the $PROJECT_NAME executing:
```
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_NAME
```

If dedicated GCS bucket doesn't exist, run:
```
gsutil mb -p $PROJECT_NAME gs://$BUCKET_NAME/
```

### Creating Google Service Account

>**NOTE:** Before following section check Prow secrets setup for the $PROJECT_NAME.

Before running following commands, export:
 - SA_NAME - Service Account name
 - SA_DISPLAY_NAME - Service Account display name
 - SECRET_FILE - the path where the private key will be written
 - ROLE - the role binded to the $SA_NAME

Create service account:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts create $SA_NAME --display-name $SA_DISPLAY_NAME
```

Create a private key for the $SA_NAME service account:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $SECRET_FILE --iam-account=SA_NAME
```

Add policy binding for the $SA_NAME service account:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding $SA_NAME --member=serviceAccount:$SA_NAME@$PROJECT_NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=$ROLE
```

### Encrypting the secret

Export following:
 - KEYRING_NAME - KMS key ring name
 - ENCRYPTION_KEY_NAME - KMS key name
 - SECRET_FILE - path to the file containing secret

Encrypt the secret:
```
gcloud kms encrypt --location global --keyring $KEYRING_NAME --key $ENCRYPTION_KEY_NAME --plaintext-file $SECRET_FILE --ciphertext-file $SECRET_FILE.encrypted
```

### Uploading the secret

Upload encrypted secret to GCP:
```
gsutil cp $SECRET_FILE.encrypted gs://$BUCKET_NAME/
```

Delete the SECRET_FILE file.
