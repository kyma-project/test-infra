# Unit Tests for Go Code

A go-unit-tests Task is used to run unit tests for Go code.
The task is tailored to be triggered by Prow as a ProwJob.
It uses a built-in `go test` command to run unit tests.

## Compatibility

- Tekton v0.36.0 and above

## Install

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kyma-project/test-infra/main/task/go-unit-tests/0.1/go-unit-tests.yaml

## Workspaces

- **repo**: The workspace where tested sources are stored. Usually, this should be a workspace shared with other
  tasks. _(REQUIRED)_

## Parameters

- **path-to-test**: The path to tested Go code. _(OPTIONAL, default: "./...")_
