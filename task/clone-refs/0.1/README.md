# Clone Repositories

The clone-refs Task clones repositories references defined by ProwJob refs and extra-refs.
ProwJob refs and extra-refs are read from the environment variable JOB_SPEC which 
is a JSON-encoded ProwJob specification and is set by Prow.
The Task clones the repositories into a workspace named "repo".
The Task uses the Kubernetes Prow clone-refs tool to clone the repositories.
