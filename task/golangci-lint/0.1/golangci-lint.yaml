  description: >-
    The golangci-lint Task runs a Golang linter.
    The task is tailored to be triggered by Prow as a ProwJob.
    It uses a golangci-lint tool.
    The GolangCI tool config is stored in the `.golangci.yaml` file in a repository hosting tested code.
    The task does not accept additional parameters to configure the linter. By default, it runs linter against all modules found under task working directory.
