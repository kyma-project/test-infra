# Go Linters

The golangci-lint Task runs a Golang linter.
The task is tailored to be triggered by Prow as a ProwJob.
It uses a golangci-lint tool.
The golangci-lint tool config is read from the `.golangci.yaml` file located in a root of repository hosting tested code.
The task does not accept additional parameters to configure the linter. By default, it runs linter against all modules found under task working directory.
The task was designed to be used against monorepos, but it can be used against repositories with single module as well.
