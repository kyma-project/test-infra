# GitHub Connector

## Overview

The GitHub Connector is an additional tool to Kyma for handling GitHub Events. It is installed in Kyma environment and registers GitHub API and Events in the Application Registry. Then, it converts incoming Events from connected GitHub webhooks into format acceptable by Kyma and forwards them to the Event Bus. See the [GitHub Connector documentation](/docs/github-connector) for more information.
