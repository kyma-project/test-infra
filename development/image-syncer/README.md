# image-syncer

## Overview

image-syncer is used to **safely** copy container images from one registry to another. 
The main use case is to preserve images from third party registries in our own registry that we can rely on.

Syncing process steps:
1. Pull image from source.
2. Check if image name contains SHA256 digest.
3. If image name contains digest, re-tag target image with the tag instead of SHA256 digest.
4. Check if image exists in target.
5. If image does not exist, re-tag image and push to target registry.  
If image exists: compare IDs. If they are different, synchronization is interrupted. It means that something is wrong and the source image was changed (this should not happen).
6. If the image signing is enabled, verify if the image matches the given KMS key. If the signature does not exist, sign the image and push the signature to the target repository. If the signature is not valid with the provided KMS key, the synchronization is interrupted.

These steps guarantee that images in our registry are immutable and verified.

## Usage

To run image-syncer, use:
```bash
go run main.go \ 
    --images-file={PATH_TO_A_YAML_FILE_CONTAINING_SYNC_DEFINITION} \
    --target-repo-auth-key={PATH_TO_A_JSON_KEY_FILE} \
    --dry-run=true \
    --kms-key=gcpkms://path/to/key
```

### Image signing

image-syncer supports safe image signing using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).
It supports only the signing that uses KMS providers supported by the sigstore package. For more information, refer to the [KMS documentation](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/KMS.md) in the `cosign` repository.
For this functionality to work, the application must have the `--key-ref` flag set to the path to the KMS resource. The resource must have the appropriate prefix, for example: `gcpkms://path/to/key` for GCP.

image-syncer also supports fine-grained control on which images to sign. The local `sign` option always has a higher priority than the global `sign` option.

### Definition file

image-syncer takes as an input parameter a file having the following structure: 

```yaml
targetRepoPrefix:  "eu.gcr.io/kyma-project/external/"
sign: true // all images will be signed by default
images:
- source: "bitnami/keycloak-gatekeeper:9.0.3"
  sign: false // this image will not be signed
- source: "bitnami/postgres-exporter:0.8.0-debian-10-r28"
- source: "busybox@sha256:31a54a0cf86d7354788a8265f60ae6acb4b348a67efbcf7c1007dd3cf7af05ab"
  tag: "1.32.0-v1"
```

### Flags

```
Usage:
  image-syncer [flags]

Flags:
      --debug                         Enables the debug mode [SYNCER_DEBUG]
      --dry-run                       Enables the dry-run mode [SYNCER_DRY_RUN]
  -h, --help                          help for image-syncer
  -i, --images-file string            Specifies the path to the YAML file that contains list of images [SYNCER_IMAGES_FILE]
  -k, --kms-key string                Specifies the path to KMS key resource (for example gcpkms://...) [SYNCER_KMS_KEY]
  -t, --target-repo-auth-key string   Specifies the JSON key file used for authorization to the target repository [SYNCER_TARGET_REPO_AUTH_KEY]
```


### Environment variables

All flags can also be set using these environment variables:

| :----------------------------- | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SYNCER_IMAGES_FILE**         |    Yes   | Path to the YAML file with the sync definition, provided as a string.|
| **SYNCER_TARGET_REPO_AUTH_KEY**|    Yes   | Path to the JSON key file, provided as a string.|
| **SYNCER_DRY_RUN**             |    No    | Value controlling the `dry run` mode, provided as a boolean.|
| **SYNCER_KMS_KEY**| Yes | URI of the KMS key from the supported provider.|
|**SYNCER_DEBUG**|No|Variable that enables the debug mode.|
