# Create Custom Image
The purpose of this document is to define how to create a new Google Compute Engine [custom image](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images?authuser=1#custom_images) with required dependencies. You can use the new image to provision virtual machine (VM) instances with all dependencies already installed. To set the created image as default custom image, add the flag `--default` when running this script.

> **NOTE:** To run the following script, make sure that you are signed in to the Google Cloud project with administrative rights.

## Image creation process

The script performs the following steps:

1. Provision a new VM under the VM instance in the Google Compute Engine.
   The new VM instance is named according to the **kyma-deps-image-vm-{RANDOM_ID}** pattern and created in a random **zone** in Europe.

2. Move the [`install-deps-debian.sh`](./install-deps-debian.sh) script to the newly provisioned VM and execute it.

3. Shut down the new VM after installing all the required dependencies specified in [`install-deps-debian.sh`](./install-deps-debian.sh).

4. Create a new **image** using `--source-disk` as **kyma-deps-image-vm-{RANDOM_ID}** under the **custom-images** image family in the Google Compute Engine. This creates a new **kyma-deps-image-{Current_Date}** image.

5. Delete the provisioned **kyma-deps-image-vm-{RANDOM_ID}** VM.
