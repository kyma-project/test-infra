# this patch is required, since kubebuilder does not allow to configure the serviceaccount name
# see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/blob/v1.0.7/pkg/scaffold/resource/rolebinding.go#L58
#
# as a workaround we have it hardcoded here but need to be fixed cause it's not maintainable at all
