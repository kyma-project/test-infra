* Version 1.11 or higher of [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
* Version 0.5.1 or higher of [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
* Version 2.0.0 of [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)
* Version 1.0.7 of [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)
* The latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* The latest version of [Mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) 

## Available controllers

### Notifier
Notifier watches all ProwJobs and sends notifications to a given Slack channel:

For information about the available configuration, see the [**Use environment variables**](#use-environment-variables) section. 

To ignore the ProwJob, add the **prow.kyma-project.io/slack.skipReport** label under the **metadata** entry in the job definition and set it to `true`.
```yaml
postsubmits:
  - name: post-master-kyma-gke-upgrade
    branches:
    - master
    labels:
      prow.kyma-project.io/slack.skipReport: true # this job will be ignored by Slack reporter
      preset-bot-github-token: "true"
      preset-build-master: "true"
    skip_report: false
  ...
```

## Usage

### Run a local version

To run the controller outside the cluster, run this command:

```bash
make run
```

### Build a production version

To build the production Docker image, run this command:

```bash
IMG={image_name}:{image_tag} make docker-build
```

The variables are:

* `{image_name}` which is the name of the output image.
* `{image_tag}` which is the tag of the output image.
