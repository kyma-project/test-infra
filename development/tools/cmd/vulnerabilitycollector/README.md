# Vulnerability Collector

## Overview
The Vulnerability Collector queries the public Google container repository API about all containers in a given project while traversing paths as they're found. The result is a generated list of containers. The Vulnerability Collector picks the latest container and runs a check for any security vulnerabilities found by the GCR.io vulnerability scanner. If a region or path is specified, the number of queries is drastically reduced.

If the **region** parameter is left out, the **global region** is taken into account. If the **region** parameter is provided, it is checked if it is either `eu` or `us`.

## Usage

To use the Vulnerability Collector, run:

```bash
go run main.go -project="kyma-project" -region="eu" -path="test-infra"
```
