# Vulnerability Collector

## Overview
The tool queries the public google container repository API for all containers it can find for a given project, while traversing paths as they're found. With the generated list of containers, it will pick the last built container and runs a check for any security vulnerabilities found from the GCR.io vulnerability scanner. If a region or path is specified, the number of queries is drastically reduced.

If the region parameter is left out, the global region is assumed. If it is passed, the region is checked if it is either `eu` or `us`.

## Usage

To use the Vulnerability Collector, run:

```bash
go run main.go -project="kyma-project" -region="eu" -path="test-infra"
```
