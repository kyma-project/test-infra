# Config Uploader

## Overview

This command uploads Prow plugins, configuration, and jobs to a Prow cluster. Use it for a newly created Prow cluster and to update changes in the configuration on a cluster from a forked repository.

## Usage

To run it, use:

```bash
go run cmd/configuploader/main.go --kubeconfig $HOME/.kube/config --plugin-config-path {pathToPluginsYaml}
```

> **NOTE:** Config Uploader expects that the `config`, `plugins`, and `job-config` ConfigMaps are present on the cluster.
