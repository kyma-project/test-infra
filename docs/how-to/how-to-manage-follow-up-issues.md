# Guidelines for Managing Follow-Up Issues

This document provides clear guidelines on how to effectively handle follow-up issues identified during events such as Technical Sprint Reviews.

## Rules
1. Always create a follow-up issue when it is identified and not resolved alongside the parent issue within the same Sprint.
2. Discuss the follow-up issue with the team during the Sprint Review or Sprint Planning sessions to ensure everyone is aware and aligned.
3. If the follow-up issue is not  added to the next Sprints:
   - Add a `technical-debt` label to indicate that this issue is a deferred concern.
   - Close the parent issue to signify that its resolution is complete.
4. If the follow-up issue is not added to the next Sprints:
   - Do not add the `technical-debt` label, as it indicates a commitment to address the issue soon.
   - Do not close the parent issue, as it remains open until the follow-up is resolved.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain clarity and accountability in our workflow while addressing technical debt effectively.
