# Label_sync
Label_sync updates or migrates github labels on repositories in a Github organisation based on a YAML file. It is trigged as a `ci-prow-label-sync` Prow job.

Label Configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/kyma-project/test-infra/blob/main/prow/labels.yaml).
More excessive documentation and a source code is available in the Kubernetes `test-infra` [repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/label_sync).
