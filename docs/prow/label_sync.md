# Label_sync
Label_sync updates or migrates GitHub labels on repositories in a GitHub organisation based on a YAML file. It is triggered as a `ci-prow-label-sync` Prow job.

For Label Configuration see the [labels](https://github.com/kyma-project/test-infra/blob/main/prow/labels.yaml) file.
See also the more extensive documentation and the source code in the [Kubernetes `test-infra` repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/label_sync).
