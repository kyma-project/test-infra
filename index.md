# Changelog Generator
This project is a Docker image that is used to generate a changelog in the `kyma` repository. It uses GitHub API to get pull requests with specified labels.

[/changelog-generator/README.md](/changelog-generator/README.md)

# Development
The purpose of the folder is to store tools developed and used in the `test-infra` repository.

[/development/README.md](/development/README.md)

# Create Custom Image
The purpose of this document is to define how to create a new Google Compute Engine [custom image](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images) with required dependencies. You can use the new image to provision virtual machine (VM) instances with all dependencies already installed.

# certbotauthenticator
Certbotauthenticator is a binary called by the certbot when it generates the certificate. The binary is used in during manual DNS challenge authentication. In the manual mode, the certbot passes the domain name and the authentication token as environment variables to the certbotauthenticator to create a TXT record in the domain. This way, the Let's Encrypt system can validate the domain ownership. After the validation completes, the certbotauthenticator is called again to clean the TXT records.

# Prow Job tester
Prow Job tester is a tool for testing changes to the Prow Jobs' definitions and code running in Prow Jobs. It uses the production Prow instance to run chosen Prow Jobs with changes from pull requests (PRs) without going through multiple cycles of new PRs, reviews, and merges. The whole development can be done within one cycle.

[/development/tools/cmd/pjtester/README.md](/development/tools/cmd/pjtester/README.md)

# Render Templates
The Render Templates is a tool that reads the configuration from a [`config.yaml`](../../../../templates/config.yaml) file and [`data`](../../../../templates/data) files to generate output files, such as Prow component jobs. While the `config.yaml` file can hold configuration for an output file, you can place such data within the data files that hold configuration for related output files. Having separate files with grouped data is cleaner and easier to maintain than one huge config file.

# Prow cluster update
Updating a Prow cluster requires an improved Prow version. The Kubernetes Prow instance gets updated via a shell script. The shell script offers only a short list of the last pushed container tags and as a result, limits the versions to choose from. To cherry-pick updates, monitor [Prow announcements](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/ANNOUNCEMENTS.md) to see when fixes or important changes are merged into the Kubernetes repository. This document describes how to update a Prow cluster using a cherry-picked Prow version.
