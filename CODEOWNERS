# This file provides an overview of code owners in the `kyma` repository.

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# For more details, read the following article on GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/.

# These are the default owners for the whole content of the `kyma` repository.
# The default owners are automatically added as reviewers when you open a pull request, unless different owners are specified in the file.

# IMPORTANT: Each path must have @neighbors-dev-bot @kyma-project/neighbors added to let automation work. Having bot added as owner explicitly while it's not a kyma-project/prow group member does not interfere with the request review automation.
