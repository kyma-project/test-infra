## Usage

1. Use `securityContext: privileged: true` for this image to run correctly.
2. Do not define the `command` directive in ProwJob or Pod definition. If you have to do it, use `/init.sh` as a value.
3. Pay attention to scripts that run inside the container.
4. To enable Docker-in-Docker you need to use the following presets:
    ```yaml
    preset-dind-enabled: true
    preset-kind-volume-mounts: true
    ```
5. Docker daemon logs will be stored in the `/var/log/dockerd.log` or in `${ARTIFACTS}/dockerd.log` when running from Prow.
