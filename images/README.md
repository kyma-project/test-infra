# Prow runtime images

This directory contains images that can be used as runtime images for all ProwJobs in Kyma's Prow Instance.

Refer to the README.md files in the image subdirectories for more information.

## Adding additional applications

To add additional applications into the images, open a PR with changes. Follow these recommendations:
* Always build from a source to ensure compiler vulnerabilities do not affect the resulting binary
* Link the binary to a specific version so that it's easier to update when necessary 
* Build binaries in a separate stage, then copy the resulting binary into the final image to ensure images are small and contain the least number of layers

## Write image tests

To write simple smoke tests with your image, add an executable file called `test.sh`.
The scripts should contain all steps that perform basic or advanced test operations against the image. You can use all binaries available in [E2E DinD K3d image](./e2e-dind-k3d) to test the built image.
The test script must exit with a non-zero number if any steps have failed.

By default, current context of a test script will always be Docker build context. Image name is passed as a variable `IMG`.

### Example

The example below showcases the example definition of the `test.sh` script.
```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
echo "$IMG"
docker run --rm $IMG -- some-command
test $? -eq 0 || exit 1
```
