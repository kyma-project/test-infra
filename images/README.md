# Prow runtime images

This directory contains images that can be used as runtime images for all ProwJobs in Kyma's Prow Instance.

Refer to the README.md files in the image subdirectories for more information.

## Adding additional applications

To add additional applications into the images, open a PR with changes. Follow these recommendations:
* Always build from a source to ensure compiler vulnerabilities do not affect the resulting binary
* Link the binary to a specific version so that it's easier to update when necessary 
* Build binaries in a separate stage, then copy the resulting binary into the final image to ensure images are small and contain the least number of layers
