# Performance test in Kyma

## Overview

The performance test setup in Kyma consists of the `load generator cluster` and `kyma cluster under load` clusters. 

For more details on the implementation of the `load generator cluster`, read [this](docs/performance-test-cluster-setup.md) document. Read more about the performance test execution [here](docs/performance-test-execution.md). The performance test in Kyma has been implemented in [K6](https://k6.io/).
